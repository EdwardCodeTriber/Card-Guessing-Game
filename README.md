# Node.js Card Guessing Game:
# Objective:
- The objective of this project is to create a card guessing game using Node.js.
- Users should be able to select two cards at a time, if they match they remain open, if they donâ€™t match they flip to hide their contents again.
- The game is won when all cards are successfully matched to their corresponding cards.
# Interface:
- Design a user-friendly interface that is intuitive for the game
- Include a total of 36 cards: 6 rows and 6 columns.
- This will bring the matching set to 18
- When the game starts, the cards should be set dynamically and remain in their selected positions until the game ends or is restarted by the user
# Features:
- When the page is opened, automatically set the cards and hide their contents.
- Users can reset the game whenever they choose, changing the position of the cards
- When the user wins, display a pop up to congratulate the user on winning.
# Persistence:
- No data is persisted
# Testing:
- Test the application thoroughly to ensure that all features work as expected
